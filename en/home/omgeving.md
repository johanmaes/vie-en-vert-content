Courtil is a small charming village in the municipality of Gouvy, located in the province of Luxembourg. The holiday home is situated in the heart of the Natural Park of the Two Ourthes (Parc Naturel des Deux Ourthes), between Vielsalm, Gouvy, Houffalize, and La Roche-en-Ardenne. It is one of the most beautiful spots in the Belgian Ardennes for hikers and cyclists. A bakery is within walking distance, as well as the renowned Lupulus brewery/brasserie. Hotel Saint-Martin also offers a delicious restaurant and is located just a 300-meter walk away.

Courtil is situated at an altitude of 480 meters, making it highly likely to experience snow in the winter. Baraque Fraiture (the highest point in the Belgian Ardennes with skiing and cross-country skiing possibilities) and Val de Wanne (with the longest ski slope in Belgium) are both just a fifteen-minute drive away.

Furthermore, within a 15-minute radius, there are plenty of enjoyable activities to do in all weather conditions. In Houffalize and La Roche-en-Ardenne, you can find adventurous activities such as kayaking, paintball, and more.
