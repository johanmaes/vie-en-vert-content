Back to reality...

3 Weeks, it seems to have flown by.

The intentions were there, but let's be honest, we didn't check everything off the list. The beginning was strong, though.

The 3-day trip turned into a 4-day one, and long mornings and evenings were limited to a quick coffee in the morning or a swift pint before bedtime.

Balance week 1: Tired but satisfied, a bit too tired for vacation mode.

Luckily, week 2 was reserved for camping life.

Perhaps a bit too cozy to rest a lot, but fun for all of us.

Parties with our annual camping friends and runs in preparation for our marathon training, that too :)

Balance week 2: Satisfied, recharged but not fully rested, and most importantly, a happy daughter!!!

With high spirits, we start our third workweek. A slightly slower pace (after all, it's 30Â°C)

Long coffee mornings, long campfire evenings with BBQs, coziness, or simply wrapping things up early to enjoy a leisurely dinner.

Work-vacation balance 10/10; After two weeks of trying, we finally succeeded ;)

In between, we also join the wine festivals in Ernst with my colleagues.

A weekend WITH a lot of food and drinks and WITHOUT work or sports.

There you have it, complete relaxation before pushing through to the bitter end.

It has been beautiful, and the results are definitely worth it!

It has literally been 'the roof of my world' for 3 weeks.

And as much as I wished for warmth in my previous blog, I now wish you a fresh start to September.

Time to shift priorities to a new school year. See you later!

Greetings, Stefanie
