The fixed routine has been in full swing for about a month now.

Our weekends in the Ardennes have always been filled with electrical and plumbing preparations, as well as installing gutters and thresholds.

It's as if we've never done anything else, cultivating a routine that goes from work/school to sports/hobbies, then to construction on the weekends, and finally to Monday, our day for home cleaning. We hit the 'repeat' button every week.

The family engine is running smoothly; we derive a lot of satisfaction from it, but we also recognize when our batteries need recharging.

The annual family and friends weekend in September/October is the perfect time for that.

And with the marathon on October 15th on the horizon, we shift our focus to something else for a while.

Although we've often thought ourselves crazy for the ambition of working full-time, building on the weekends, and running a marathon in the same year (for my 41st birthday/bucket list), we can also say that it's that very ambition and tight planning that has ensured there's variety in everything we do, that it stays enjoyable, and that we're excited to be on the road for almost 2 hours every Friday evening!

Maybe it's also the prospect of more rest after October 15th and the arrival of the windows at the end of October that gives us our wings back.

So, it's quieter indoor work for November ðŸ˜‰

Positive vibes once again carry us through another month.

We'll tell you how the works progress in November and what this month has in store for us next time.

See you soon,

Stefanie
