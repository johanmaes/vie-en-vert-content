Exciting!! With that impression, I want to start my blog.

A first time writing for people, a first time doing a project with our whole family, a first time for everything, so let's not sit around doing nothing!

One, two, three, Here we go...

Our entire adventure actually starts with our love for nature. From the national parks in America to the islands of Thailand, in nature, we are always the best version of ourselves.

With the birth of our daughter in 2010, we are forced to fulfill our hunger for adventure a bit closer to home. Conclusion: Same amount of tranquility, the same feeling, just closer to home. Thus, the Ardennes gradually becomes a second home for us. A place to get away from everything and enjoy each other, friends, and family.

When our daughter Free wakes us up at a very young age to go on long hikes in nature, the idea of buying something permanent in the Ardennes arises more and more. And so it happened... After many campfires and numerous local beers, we make the decision. We're building our own little place!

The idea of letting other families enjoy each other, find tranquility here, and experience the same vibe led us to the project we have now started:

May I proudly introduce you: La Vie en Vert! The what, how, and why, I'll gladly share with you in my monthly blog. I hope this will take you along a bit in our adventure, one of hard work, but hopefully even more of enjoying life to the fullest!

See you in July!

Greetings, Stefanie
