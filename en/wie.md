We are a family from a small town called Heultje in Belgium. It's a lovely neighborhood where we were all born and raised. Full of energy, interests, and dreams, we take a leap into the unknown to give shape to our shared passions.

It's nature, adventure, and tranquility that bring us closer together time and time again. Long walks, delicious food, aperitif moments with family, and long campfire evenings with friends.

The Ardennes has become our second home. It's precisely this "La vie en vert" that we want to share with our guests. We won't settle for anything less! With heart and soul, we hope to pass on the "Ardennes vibes" to you.

Hope to see you soon! Stefanie, Steven, and Free
